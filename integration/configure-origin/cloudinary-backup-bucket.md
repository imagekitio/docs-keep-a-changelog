# Cloudinary Backup Bucket

You can add your existing Cloudinary backup bucket as an origin in ImageKit.io. This allows you to use ImageKit.io real-time image optimization and resizing features on all existing images stored in the bucket.

**Note:** We do not start copying images from your bucket as soon as you add it. Instead, we will fetch the particular image when you request it through ImageKit.io URL-endpoint. [Learn more](../how-it-works.md) to understand how this works. The images accessed from this origin will not appear in your [Media library](../../media-library/overview/).

## Step 1: Configure origin

1. Go to the [external storage section](https://imagekit.io/dashboard#external-storage) in your ImageKit.io dashboard, and under the Origins section, click on the "Add origin" button.
2. Choose **Cloudinary Backup Bucket** from the origin type dropdown.
3. Give your origin a name, it will appear in the list of origins you have added. For example - **Product images bucket**.
4. Fill out the bucket name.
5. Specify the bucket folder in which your images are present. If you have to access files at the root (i.e., present directly in the bucket and not inside a folder), enter `/`.
6. Fill out the access and secret keys. These keys should provide read-only access to ImageKit.io as explained below.
7. Leave the [advanced options](amazon-s3-bucket-origin.md#advanced-options-for-s3-type-origin) as it is for now.
8. Click on the Submit button.

**Read-only permission required**\
ImageKit.io needs read-only access to your storage bucket. You can refer to your Cloudinary's documentation to figure out how to provide read-only access to a bucket.
{% endhint %}

## Step 2: Access the image through ImageKit.io URL-endpoint

When you add your first origin in the dashboard, the origin is by default made accessible through the [default URL-endpoint](../url-endpoints.md#default-url-endpoint) of your ImageKit.io account. For subsequent origins, you can either create a separate URL-endpoint or edit the existing URL-endpoint (including default) and make this newly added origin accessible by editing the [origin preference list](../url-endpoints.md#image-origin-preference). 

Let's look at a few examples to fetch the images:

* **Original image through Cloudinary bucket (old URL)**\
  ****[https://cloudinary.com/rest-of-the-path.jpg](https://example.com/rest-of-the-path.jpg)
* **The same master image using ImageKit.io URL-endpoint**\
  ****[https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg](https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg)
* **Resized 300x300 image**\
  ****[https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/`tr:w-300,h-300`/rest-of-the-path.jpg](https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/tr:w-300,h-300/rest-of-the-path.jpg)

So when you request `https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg`, ImageKit.io internally access the object at path `rest-of-the-path.jpg` in your bucket.

## Step 3: Integrate and Go live

Now start using ImageKit.io URL endpoint in your application to accelerate image loading.

## Handling special characters in the filename

While fetching images from your Cloudinary bucket with special characters in the name, you will get a `404 NOT FOUND` response. For example, let’s assume that there is a key `image%2Bexample.jpg` in your Cloudinary bucket, and the request is made using `image+example.jpg` in the URL. In this case, ImageKit.io tries to fetch `image+example.jpg` object from the Cloudinary bucket resulting in a 404 error as this object does not exist.

While adding the origin in your ImageKit.io account, you are now provided with an option to encode the keys while fetching the object from your Cloudinary bucket. By default, this option is disabled. When enabled, the requests made while fetching images will be made using encoded keys.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**\
****At present, this feature can only be enabled upon request, please email support at support@imagekit.io.
{% endhint %}

## Advanced options for Cloudinary type origin

### Include canonical response header

When enabled, the image response contains a Link header with the appropriate URL and rel=canonical. You will have to specify the base URL for the canonical header.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/wp71hwsnlvmmdthvbsj8.png)

For example, if you set `https://www.example.com` as the base URL for canonical header, then the image response for URL `https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg` will have a Link header like this:

```http
Link: <https://www.example.com/rest-of-the-path.jpg>; rel="canonical"
```
