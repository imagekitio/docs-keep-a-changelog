# S3 Compatible External Storages

If your storage provider is S3-compatible, i.e., it can be interfaced with using the S3 API and specification, you can seamlessly integrate your storage buckets with your ImageKit account. Suppose your images are originally stored on S3-compatible storage like Digital Ocean Spaces or Wasabi. In that case, you can add the bucket on which your images reside as an origin in your ImageKit configuration.

Most of the following procedure is identical to adding your own vanilla [Amazon S3 bucket as an origin](https://docs.imagekit.io/integration/configure-origin/amazon-s3-bucket-origin). All of the options and inputs remain the same, except for the endpoint input parameter. By default, the AWS SDK will try to access your specified bucket at standard, region-based S3 endpoints. However, when you are using a third party S3 compatible storage provider such as Wasabi, you need to specify the custom endpoint corresponding to your storage provider. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Endpoint.html).

For instance, here's an example endpoint for Wasabi storage:`https://s3.wasabisys.com` found on '[What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different regions?](https://wasabi-support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-regions-)'. You can similarly find the appropriate endpoint for your S3 compatible storage provider in their documentation.

**Note:** We do not start copying images from your bucket as soon as you add it. Instead, we will fetch the particular image when you request it through ImageKit.io URL-endpoint. [Learn more](../how-it-works.md) to understand how this works. The images accessed from this origin will not appear in your [Media library](../../media-library/overview/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Amazon S3 buckets in regions launched after 2019-03-20, such as South Africa (Cape Town), Middle East (Bahrain) and Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), must be added to ImageKit as S3 compatible external storages with the endpoint of that region, (e.g. `https://af-south-1.s3.amazonaws.com`).
{% endhint %}

## Step 1: Configure origin

1. Go to the [external storage section](https://imagekit.io/dashboard#external-storage) in your ImageKit.io dashboard, and under the Origins section, click on the "Add origin" button.
2. Choose **S3 Compatible Storages** from the origin type dropdown.
3. Give your origin a name, it will appear in the list of origins you have added. For example - **Wasabi - Product images bucket**.
4. Fill out the S3 bucket name.
5. Specify the S3 bucket folder in which your images are present. If you have to access files at the root (i.e., present directly in the bucket and not inside a folder), enter `/`.
6. Fill out S3 access and secret keys. These keys should provide read-only access to ImageKit.io as explained below.
7. Enter the custom **endpoint** for your storage provider as explained above.
8. Leave the [advanced options](amazon-s3-bucket-origin.md#advanced-options-for-s3-type-origin) as it is for now.
9. Click on the Submit button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Read-only permission required**\
ImageKit.io needs read-only access to your storage bucket. You can refer to your S3-Compatible storage provider's documentation to figure out how to provide read-only access to a bucket.
{% endhint %}

## Step 2: Access the image through ImageKit.io URL-endpoint

When you add your first origin in the dashboard, the origin is by default made accessible through the [default URL-endpoint](../url-endpoints.md#default-url-endpoint) of your ImageKit.io account. For subsequent origins, you can either create a separate URL-endpoint or edit the existing URL-endpoint (including default) and make this newly added origin accessible by editing the [origin preference list](../url-endpoints.md#image-origin-preference). 

Let's look at a few examples to fetch the images:

* **Original image through S3 bucket (old URL)**\
  [https://example.com/rest-of-the-path.jpg](https://example.com/rest-of-the-path.jpg)
* **The same master image using ImageKit.io URL-endpoint**\
  [https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg](https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg)
* **Resized 300x300 image**\
  [https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/`tr:w-300,h-300`/rest-of-the-path.jpg](https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/tr:w-300,h-300/rest-of-the-path.jpg)

So when you request `https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg`, ImageKit.io internally access the object at path `rest-of-the-path.jpg` in your bucket.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="URL structure" %}
```markup
            URL-endpoint                transformation      image path                                    
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐┌─────────────┐┌───────────────────┐
https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/tr:w-300,h-300/rest-of-the-path.jpg
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If you get a "Not found" error while accessing the image, check out this [troubleshooting guide](../../limits-and-troubleshooting/404-not-found-error-troubleshooting.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
:man_mage:**Tips:** You can also use a [custom domain](../../testing-and-infrastructure-setup/using-custom-domain-name.md) like images.example.com.
{% endhint %}

## Step 3: Integrate and Go live

Now start using ImageKit.io URL endpoint in your application to accelerate image loading.

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../api-reference/api-introduction/sdk.md" %}
[sdk.md](../../api-reference/api-introduction/sdk.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Handling special characters in the filename

While fetching images from your S3 bucket with special characters in the name, you will get a `404 NOT FOUND` response. For example, let’s assume that there is a key `image%2Bexample.jpg` in your S3 bucket, and the request is made using `image+example.jpg` in the URL. In this case, ImageKit.io tries to fetch `image+example.jpg` object from the S3 bucket resulting in a 404 error as this object does not exist.

While adding the origin in your ImageKit.io account, you are now provided with an option to encode the keys while fetching the object from your S3 bucket. By default, this option is disabled. When enabled, the requests made while fetching images will be made using encoded keys.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**\
****At present, this feature can only be enabled upon request, please email support at support@imagekit.io.
{% endhint %}

## Advanced options for S3 type origin

### Include canonical response header

When enabled, the image response contains a Link header with the appropriate URL and rel=canonical. You will have to specify the base URL for the canonical header.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/wp71hwsnlvmmdthvbsj8.png)

For example, if you set `https://www.example.com` as the base URL for canonical header, then the image response for URL `https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id/rest-of-the-path.jpg` will have a Link header like this:

```http
Link: <https://www.example.com/rest-of-the-path.jpg>; rel="canonical"
```
### Use path-style URLs instead of virtual-hosted style URLs

When enabled, path-style URLs will be used instead of the default, [virtual-hosted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html) style URLs while fetching the image from your S3-compatible storage provider. This may be useful if your provider does not yet support the virtual-hosted style URLs i.e. URLs where the bucket name is a part of the hostname.

For example, if your service provider's endpoint is `https://s3.wasabisys.com`, your bucket is named `product-images`, and your file is named `red-dress.jpg`, then the URL generated as per each style will be:

```markup
virtual-hosted [default]: https://product-images.s3.wasabisys.com/red-dress.jpg
path-style: https://s3.wasabisys.com/product-images/red-dress.jpg
```
