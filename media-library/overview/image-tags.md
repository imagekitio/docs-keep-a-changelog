# Image tagging and searching

Image tagging is a good practice to sort and search images, as tags are additional attributes attached to an image file during the initial file upload or at some point later.

For example: If you have a picture of a man wearing a t-shirt on your website, then you might want some additional attributes attached to the image, other than its metadata, like:

1. Colour: Black
2. Collar: Round Neck
3. Sleeve: Short Sleeve
4. Material: Cotton
5. Print: Solid

This information might not be possibly reflected in the image name, and neither is it easy to organize the resources based on these attributes. Image Tags help with such day-to-day problems.

## Add tags

You can either add tags while [uploading the image](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/), or add tags from the ImageKit.io Media Library.

To add a tag to an image, right-click on the file to open the menu. Click on the "Tags" menu item. This will open a popup, enter the tags you want, and press the "Save" button.

## Add/remove tags in bulk

You can select multiple files together by pressing and holding the Command key in Mac or the Ctrl key in Windows. Right-click on any file to open menu options. Select "Add Bulk Tags" or "Remove Bulk Tags" option. This will open a popup, enter the tag values, and press the "Save" button.

## Search with tags

The advanced search mode in the media library allows you to find the exact file you need by creating search queries. These queries can range from a simple search by tag to a complex combination of tags and other search filters.

Learn more about the [advanced search](search-update-and-delete.md#advanced-searching) mode and how to search for images by tag from the dashboard.

{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also search for images by tags programmatically using the[ List and Search files API](https://docs.imagekit.io/api-reference/media-api/list-and-search-files).

## Update tags

You can update the tags from the media library or using the [file update API](../../api-reference/media-api/update-file-details.md) as well.

To update a tag to a file in the media library, right-click on the file to open the menu. Click on the "Tags" menu item. This will open a popup, enter the tags you want, and press the "Save" button.
