# Upload files

Currently, you can upload images and static files to the media library in two ways - using the dashboard, and using the [upload API](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/). ImageKit.io currently supports [these formats for upload](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/#allowed-mime-types-for-uploading).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Info:** When uploading images, ImageKit.io appends a random string to the image file name to avoid replacing images with the same file name. You can turn off this setting within the Upload Section of [Image Settings](https://imagekit.io/dashboard#settings) within the dashboard.
{% endhint %}

## Using the Upload API

You can also upload images to ImageKit.io's media library programmatically. Read the Upload API documentation [here](../../api-reference/upload-file-api/).
