# Custom focus area

ImageKit's real-time image manipulation allows you to resize and crop images. While cropping, you may want to preserve a certain part of the image. Media library allows you to define a focus area on the uploaded image files and later crop around it using [`fo-custom`](../../features/image-transformations/resize-crop-and-other-transformations.md#example-focus-using-custom-coordinates) URL parameter.

## How to define a custom focus area on image files
