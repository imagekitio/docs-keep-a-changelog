### Account administrator

User with this role has full access to your ImageKit.io account and can add other users with account administrator role. Best for people managing the complete account.

### Developer

A user with a developer role can access everything except user management and billing. Your development team member should have this role.

### Media library full access

A user with this role has full access to the media library. This role is suitable for marketing team members who need to upload marketing assets, create new folders or tag media files etc.

### Media library view-only access

A user with this role has view-only access to the media library. This user cannot upload media assets or create new folders. The user can only open and search the already upload files & folders.

### Media library restricted access
