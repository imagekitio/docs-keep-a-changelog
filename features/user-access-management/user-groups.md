ImageKit's Digital Asset Management workflow provides a simple way to share assets and media collections with teams. You can simplify your workflow by configuring asset or media collection access permissions to user groups, which can be associated with many users, as opposed to defining those permissions for one media library restricted user at a time.

Note that you can only add media library restricted users to a user group.

Go to the User management section in ImageKit's dashboard. Under the User groups tab in the side menu, you will find the following options:

- View existing user group details.
- Create new user groups and add users to it.
- Update an existing user group's name and add or remove users from it.
- Delete user group.

**User group limits**
- There are no limits to the number of users that can be added to a user group.
- There are no limits to the number of user groups that can be created.
- A user group's name is unique and case-insensitive. They can only contain alphabets, numbers, and spaces.

## Access control and sharing

Read about access sharing and permission levels [here](../../access-control-and-permissions/README.md). You can define the permission level for restricted media library users through user groups on your assets and media collections as per your organizations requirements and DAM workflow.

When a user group is deleted, users lose access to any files, folders, or media collections that they had access to through the group.

When a user's role is changed from "Restricted media library access" to some other role or when any such user is deleted, they are removed from the user group.
