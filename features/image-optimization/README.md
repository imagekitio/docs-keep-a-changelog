# Image Optimization

ImageKit.io offers multiple features including automatic best format selection, quality optimization, and metadata manipulation out of the box, to reduce the final size of the output image. This improves the load time of your website's images while maintaining acceptable image quality.

Many of these features, like automatic format conversion and metadata removal, are turned ON by default, in line with the standard practices on the web.

The following features related to image optimization can be found in your dashboard under the [Image Settings](https://imagekit.io/dashboard/settings/images) section.
