# Quality Optimization

## Video quality

Similar to images, there is a tradeoff between visual quality and file sizes. However, it is possible to compress a video file without any loss in perceptual visual quality.

ImageKit.io allows you to choose a quality level between `1` and `100`. `1` results in the lowest perceptual quality and smallest file size. `100` results in the highest perceptual quality and biggest file size.

Choosing 100 quality will not improve an already low-quality video. However, it will increase the size of the video file. It is recommended to not use a 100 quality setting.

## Frequently asked questions

### How to enable/disable video quality optimization

Video quality optimization is off by default. You can enable or disable it for your account under [video settings](https://imagekit.io/dashboard?redirectTo=settings-videos-optimization) in your dashboard.

Select settings from the left main menu. Inside Videos, under optimization, toggle "optimize video quality" control.

### How to override quality?

Use `q` parameter to override default quality settings.

For example, a video file served in `q-20` is 397KB in size and has relatively low perceptual quality compared to a `q-90` which is around 7.6MB.
