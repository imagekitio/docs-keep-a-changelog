# Video Optimization

Websites with video lead to higher engagement and sales. But videos files are big and it is important that you deliver the video properly and ensure that the playback of the video is seamless and doesn't stall. When a smaller video is downloaded, video playback occurs sooner, and the video buffer fills up faster.

ImageKit.io offers multiple video optimization features that work out of the box. For example, automatic best format selection and quality optimization reduce the final size of the output video.

Automatic format conversion and quality compression are turned ON by default, in line with the standard practices for delivering videos on the web.
